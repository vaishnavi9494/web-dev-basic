            <p id="rest">
            Navigational satellites are satellites which use radio time signals transmitted to enable mobile receivers on the ground to determine their exact location. The relatively clear line of sight between the satellites and receivers on the ground, combined with ever-improving electronics, allows satellite navigation systems to measure location to accuracies on the order of a few meters in real time.

            <p id="title">DESIGN CONSIDERATION</p>
 <p id="rest">The two major consideration of these types of satellites are Space segment and the Ground Segment.<br>
Space segment:<br>
The constellation consists of 7 satellites. Three of the seven satellites are located in geostationary orbit (GEO) at 32.5° E, 83° E, and 131.5° E longitude, approximately 36,000 km (22,000 mi) above earth surface. Remaining four satellites are in inclined geosynchronous orbit (GSO). Two of them cross equator at 55° E and two at 111.75° E.[37][38] The four GSO satellites will appear to be moving in the form of an "8".<br>
Ground segment:<br>
Ground Segment is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the IRNSS constellation. The Ground segment comprises:<br>

            <P id="title">APPROACH</p>
            <p id="rest">
                The signal emitted from each satellite is a microwave radio wave containing the time it was transmitted and the satellite’s current orbital position. As signals travel at the speed of light then (if your time-keeping is accurate enough) by calculating the time difference between the satellite signal and your receiver, you can derive the precise distance the signal has travelled from the satellite to reach your receiver. Ultra-precise satellite navigation relies on the same basic principle as counting the seconds after a lightning flash before the accompanying thunder is heard, in order to estimate a storm’s remoteness: a time value is converted into a reckoning of distance.

            <p id="title">APPLICATIONS</p>
            <p>  
            <ul id="rest">
<li>The original motivation for satellite navigation was for military applications. Satellite navigation allows precision in the delivery of weapons to targets, greatly increasing their lethality whilst reducing inadvertent casualties from mis-directed weapons.</li>
<li>Satellite navigation also allows forces to be directed and to locate themselves more easily, reducing the fog of war.</li>
<li>Now a global navigation satellite system, such as Galileo, is used to determine users location and the location of other people or objects at any given moment. The range of application of the satellite in the future is enormous, including both the public and private sectors across numerous market segments such as science, transport, agriculture etc.</li> 
<li>The ability to supply satellite navigation signals is also the ability to deny their availability.</li> 
<li>The operator of a satellite navigation system potentially has the ability to degrade or eliminate satellite navigation services over any territory it desires.</li>
