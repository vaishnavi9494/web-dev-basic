        <p id="rest"> Artificial satellites are man-made objects orbiting the earth and other planets in the solar system. 
            These are used to study the earth, other planets, to help us communicate and even to observe the distant universe.
             Artificial satellites can have a range of mission including scientific research, weather observation, military support, earth imaging and navigation.

            Satellites can operate by themselves or as part of a larger system. Satellites could be put to multiple uses like make star maps of planetary surfaces and also take pictures of planets they are launched into. Common types include military civilian earth observation satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites and space telescopes. Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit or also satellites. 
            One of the classification of satellites could be based on the purpose for which it  is launched. Based on this approach the satellites could be categorized as:
